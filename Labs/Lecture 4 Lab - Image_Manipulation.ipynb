        "\n",
        "In image processing, converting an image to grayscale is a common operation that simplifies the image by reducing its color information to just shades of gray. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where color is not important for analysis or when we want to reduce computational complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Understanding Grayscale Conversion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A grayscale image is one where each pixel only contains intensity information, typically represented as a value between 0 (black) and 255 (white). To convert a color image to grayscale, we need to combine the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color channels into a single channel.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Weighted Sum Method:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common method for converting an image to grayscale is by calculating a weighted sum of the RGB values. This is because different colors contribute differently to perceived brightness. The human eye is more sensitive to green light, followed by red and blue. Therefore, the weighted sum method applies different weights to each color channel to reflect this sensitivity:\n",
